</ul>

<H2>HPE Enterprise, Python Developer/IT, Contract</H2>
<H3>April 2021 - April 2023</H3>
<ul>
    <li>Created a detailed Python script (among others) designed to remotely collect data from all Linux systems within
        the network's purview. This script provided customizable command-line switches, facilitating data retrieval for
        critical parameters such as "load averages," "uptime," "tasks," "CPU usage," "memory utilization," and of course,
        an "all” switch to collect everything.</li>
    <li>Utilized an internal GitHub repository dedicated to housing and managing the suite of Python scripts developed.
        This ensured streamlined availability and effective collaboration among cross-functional team members.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the efficiency and security of server operations by implementing proactive monitoring measures and automating
        routine tasks, reducing system downtime, and optimizing resource utilization.</li>
    <li>Collaborated with IT to identify issues and implement necessary fixes or equipment upgrades.</li>
    <li>Developed and maintained detailed documentation for Python scripts, server configurations, and operational procedures
        to ensure knowledge transfer and facilitate future troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Baker Hughes, Quality Assurance Engineer</H2>
<H3>Feb 2007 - April 2020</H3>
<ul>
    <li>Requirements Analyst in charge of collecting and prioritizing features for a wireline tool in development. 
        Led meetings, verified potential features met management expectations and time constraints, and finally, wrote 
        a summary report itemizing the tool’s expected behavior and potential revenue potential. Highlighted this downhole 
        tool’s competitive advantage over other similar tools by competing oil service companies.</li>
    <li>Wrote multiple Python scripts tailored to collect information that was used to provide health reports for systems
        in the server farm. The data came from various server sources starting with Nmap discovery scans to group servers,
        switches, and storage devices accurately, automation of SNMP setups, remote Python version upgrades using Pyenv,
        and Zabbix reporting and using its API to collect other data as well. These results, in addition to remote script
        automation helped provide an accurate picture of the state of these appliances.</li>
    <li>Cultivated expertise in testing procedures by using customized VM templates as test environments for the AUT, which
        can be quickly restored to pristine states at the culmination of each test cycle.</li>
    <li>Wrote Python automation scripts to augment manual testing efforts for rig software applications. These scripts optimized
        testing procedures, enhancing the overall efficiency of software validation.</li>
    <li>Steered Agile sprint requirements, testing and demonstrating product feature additions to the product owners over
        several sprint cycles, ardently adhering to rigorous Agile/Scrum methodologies.</li>
    <li>In collaboration with Baker Hughes field engineers (out internal customers), participated in and presented reports
        at bi-weekly meetings for comprehensive requirement gathering, ensuring alignment with sprint objectives. Beyond the
        realm of testing, delivered demonstrations to our product owners, verifying requirements are met, and showcasing
        tangible enhancements made by the team. This fostered transparency and synchronization with project objectives.</li>
    <li>Administered all facets of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as needed, creating appropriate test scenarios
        based on which stage the product was entering.</li>
    <li>Maintained long term upkeep of the VM repository housing test VMs, a valuable resource for Scrum team members and QA
        reps. This innovative initiative empowered testers and developers to execute code debugging with better results.
        Testers invariably possessed access to untarnished VMs, complete with essential patches and preinstalled applications.
        This endeavour ushered in a significant acceleration of testing and development turnaround for ongoing projects.</li>
